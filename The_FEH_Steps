Step 1:
  Upload the images in either .jpg .jpg or .tiff format to the /home/pi//Pictures/ directory 

Step 2:
  Install the feh package on to your RasPI
    sudo apt install feh -y

Step 3:
  After installation here is the command to get you started
    feh -qrYzFD120 /home/pi/Pictures/

-q = quiet mode 
-r = recursive ( that means use all files in this directory
-Y = hide the pointer
-z = randomize (the photos will be random)
-F = full screen
-D<time> = delay of x amount of seconds before proceeding to the next image
--zoom <parameter> = fill the display with image (people sometimes use -zoom fill , but it doesn't do well with large images all the time)
    Example:  feh -qrYzFD120 --zoom fill /home/pi/Pictures/
    
Step 4:
  Resolving this common error "feh ERROR: Can't open X display.  It *is* running, yeah? "
  
  To resolve this error type this in to the terminal :
    export DISPLAY=:0
